## **Design Choices and Limitations**

### **Design Choices**
1. **Systolic Array Architecture**: The project uses a **32x32 systolic array** to balance computational performance and resource utilization. This size was chosen to achieve parallelism without exceeding the FPGA's resource capacity.
2. **Logic Elements (LE) vs. DSP Blocks**: The decision to use **Logic Elements** over **DSP blocks** for multiplication was based on achieving higher operating frequency due to the reduced routing distance in the Cyclone V FPGA.
3. **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Fixed-point arithmetic was selected over floating-point to minimize hardware resource usage, thus reducing complexity and power consumption.

### **Limitations**
1. **Scalability**: The current **32x32 systolic array** size limits the scalability of the accelerator for much larger matrix operations, which would require significant resource expansion.
2. **Precision**: The use of **8-bit fixed-point** limits precision, which might not be sufficient for all LLM applications, especially those requiring higher numerical accuracy.
3. **Fixed Clock Frequency**: The design operates at a **fixed 50 MHz clock frequency**, which may limit performance compared to dynamically clocked systems capable of adjusting frequency based on workload demands.

## **Design Issues and Optimization**

### **Design Issues**
1. **Routing Congestion**: The usage of **DSP blocks** resulted in lower performance due to routing congestion, especially for larger systolic arrays. This highlighted a need for careful consideration of resource types in FPGA-based designs.
2. **Data Flow Synchronization**: Ensuring proper synchronization between the **Input Buffer**, **Systolic Array**, and **Output Buffer** was challenging, particularly with the need to maintain continuous data flow without stalls.

### **Optimization Strategies**
1. **Routing Optimization**: By switching from **DSP blocks** to **Logic Elements** for the multiplier implementation, routing paths were shortened, significantly boosting the operating frequency of larger systolic arrays.
2. **Pipelining**: Additional pipeline stages were added at critical points to reduce the length of combinational paths, thus improving timing and ensuring the design met the **50 MHz** clock constraint.
3. **Control Signal Synchronization**: The addition of **pipeline registers** for control signals helped align data availability across different modules, reducing the risk of stalls or synchronization issues.

## **Timing Constraints and Optimization**  
The project is constrained to a **50 MHz clock frequency** on the Cyclone V FPGA. Timing challenges and solutions include:  
- **Clock Definition**: A 20 ns clock period is defined with a balanced waveform for reliable timing analysis.  
- **Optimizations**:  
  - **Pipeline Registers**: Added to synchronize control signals and reduce critical paths.  
  - **Clock Skew Management**: Adjusted clock uncertainty to ensure signal stability.

## **Design Testing**  
Each module was individually tested to verify its functionality. Integrated testing ensured synchronization and correctness of the entire design.  

**Testing Highlights**:  
- Verified accurate matrix multiplication outputs.  
- Ensured proper timing synchronization through pipeline registers and control signal adjustments.

## **Implementation Details and Results**  
- **Implementation**: Synthesized on **Altera Cyclone V FPGA** using Intel Quartus Prime.  
- **Results**:  
  - Achieved reliable matrix multiplication operations at 50 MHz.  
  - Efficient resource utilization with no timing violations.  
  - High throughput and accurate results verified through simulation and hardware testing.  
  - **Systolic Array Performance**: The systolic array achieved a **maximum operating frequency of 450 MHz** for a **32x32, 8-bit wide** configuration using **Logic Elements (LE)** for multiplication. In contrast, using **DSP blocks** for the same configuration resulted in a maximum frequency of **155 MHz**. The **Quartus Timing Analyzer** indicated that the longer routing distance required to access DSP blocks led to the slower performance, making it more advantageous to use LEs for certain sizes of systolic arrays where lower latency was essential. However, for smaller configurations, such as **16x16** arrays, both DSP and LE-based implementations achieved similar performance levels, demonstrating that routing distance played a key role in performance differences only at larger scales.

## **Future Work and Improvements**  
1. **Enhanced Scalability**: Expand systolic array size to support larger matrix operations.  
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize multipliers for lower power consumption.  
3. **Floating-Point Support**: Add support for higher precision computations.  
4. **Advanced Timing Optimization**: Explore more precise clock constraints to further improve performance.
