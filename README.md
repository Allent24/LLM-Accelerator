# LLM Accelerator
Project done by students at Rowan University under PI Dwaipayan Chakraborty during the Fall 2024 semester.

## Main Branch
The main branch contains two demos utilized to determine the functionality of the Microchip SoC.
* DDR Demo: Stress tests the DDR memory and controller and reports any errors
* Assembly Demo: Tests the functionality of in-line assembly on the FPGA

## Other branches
Two other branches contain the Verilog design for our project. Please visit those branches for all code and more detailed infromation.
